            <p> Dentoji, operated by Technoji Global Private Limited, is committed to protecting the privacy and 
confidentiality of its users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, process, and 
protect the information you provide while using the Dentoji platform. By accessing or using the 
platform, users agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and consent to the 
collection and processing of their information in accordance with applicable laws, including the 
Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (India) and, where applicable, the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR). <br></br> <br></br></p>

<p>We collect personal information directly from users when they register on the platform, create or 
update accounts, schedule appointments, upload patient records, make payments, or interact 
with the platform in any other way. Information collected may include names, contact details, 
demographic information, health records, medical history, appointment details, billing data, and 
other information voluntarily provided by users. For practitioners and clinics, registration details 
such as professional licenses, certifications, and practice information may also be collected. 
Technical information such as IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage logs may be 
automatically gathered to ensure system security and to improve platform performance.</p> <br></br> <br></br>

    <p>The information collected is used for legitimate business purposes, including providing and 
improving platform services, maintaining accurate patient and clinic records, scheduling and 
managing appointments, processing payments, generating reports, ensuring compliance with 
applicable laws, and enhancing user experience. Information may also be used to communicate 
with users, send alerts and updates, provide customer support, and notify users of changes to 
terms, services, or policies. <br></br> <br></br></p>

<p>Dentoji respects the ownership of data. All patient and clinic information belongs to the 
respective clinic or healthcare provider. Dentoji acts only as a data processor and custodian, 
storing and managing data on behalf of the clinic. Data will not be sold, rented, or shared with 
third parties for marketing purposes. Sharing of data may occur only in the following cases: with 
explicit consent from the user, where it is legally required under applicable law or court order, or 
where it is necessary to protect the safety and rights of users or the company. <br></br> <br></br></p>

<p>We implement industry-standard security measures to safeguard all personal and health 
information. These measures include data encryption, secure servers, restricted access 
controls, and regular backups to minimize risks of unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or 
destruction. While we take all reasonable steps to protect user data, no system is completely 
immune to security risks, and users acknowledge that they share information at their own 
discretion. <br></br> <br></br></p>

<p>Data is retained for as long as accounts remain active or as required to fulfill the purposes 
outlined in this Privacy Policy. In the event of account termination, users will have a thirty-day 
window to retrieve their data, following which the information will be permanently deleted from 
our servers unless retention is required by applicable law. <br></br> <br></br></p>

<p>Users have rights over their data, including the right to access their personal information, 
request corrections, request deletion, restrict processing, and obtain copies of their data in a 
portable format. Requests relating to user rights will be addressed in accordance with the Digital 
Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and, where applicable, GDPR. Users may also withdraw 
consent to data processing at any time; however, withdrawal of consent may affect access to 
platform services. <br></br> <br></br></p>

<p>Dentoji may update or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be 
communicated through the platform or by other reasonable means. Continued use of the 
platform after such updates shall constitute acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Users are 
encouraged to review the policy periodically to remain informed of how their information is being 
managed. <br></br> <br></br></p>

<p>For concerns, complaints, or questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of user 
data, a designated Grievance Officer shall be available. The contact details of the Grievance 
Officer, including name, email address, and phone number, will be published on the platform in 
compliance with legal requirements. Users may reach out to the Grievance Officer to resolve 
issues within a reasonable timeframe. <br></br> <br></br></p>

<p>In the event that any part of this Privacy Policy is held invalid or unenforceable by applicable 
law, the remaining provisions shall continue in full effect. By using the Dentoji platform, users 
acknowledge and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
